The dataset contains articles and related metadata extracted from Wikipedia. It typically includes  the follwing columns: title,summary,categories and page_url with around 8000 different which can be used in many applications such as : 
A. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
1.Training models for text summarization, keyword extraction, or sentiment analysis.
2.Building question-answering systems or chatbots.
B. Machine Learning:
1.Using the content for text classification models.
2.Entity recognition and linking to improve search engines.
C. Data Analysis:
1.Analyzing the frequency of topics, trends over time, or category distributions.
D. Search Engine Optimization:
1.Developing algorithms for efficient search and ranking.
E. Education & Research:
Building a research tool that extracts or analyzes historical information from articles.

The instruction of getting the data from Wikipedia are :
•	Install Required Libraries(!pip install wikipedia-api) 
•	import libraries(import wikipediaapi)
•	Initialize the Wikipedia API: The code uses the `wikipedia-api` library to access Wikipedia articles. An object named `wiki_wiki` is created to access the English version of Wikipedia with a user-defined agent.
•	Define the Data Collection Function: The function `get_wikipedia_data` is responsible for retrieving the title, summary (the first 500 characters), categories, and the full URL of a given Wikipedia page.
•	Initial List of Topics: A list of initial topics, such as 'Machine Learning,' 'Artificial Intelligence,' and others, is defined to start the data collection process4.   Track Collected Topics: A set named `collected_topics` tracks which topics have already been processed to avoid duplicates.
•	Data Collection Loop: A `while` loop is implemented to continue fetching data until at least 8,000 records are collected. Related topics (internal links) are added to the `topics` list as the code progresses.
•	Rate Limiting: The program includes `time. sleep(1)` to pause briefly between requests, respecting Wikipedia's servers and avoiding excessive requests.
•	Store Data in a DataFrame: The data collected (title, summary, categories, and URL) for each topic is stored in a list and then converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
•	Save Data to CSV: After collecting the data, the DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named `wikipedia_data.csv`. This file contains the data for further analysis.
•	Convert to Excel: The CSV data is converted into an Excel file named `wikipedia_data.xlsx` using the `openpyxl` engine. This Excel file is then made available for download.
•	Install Dependencies for MongoDB: Necessary libraries (`pymongo` and `openpyxl`) are installed to connect to MongoDB and manage Excel files.
•	Establish MongoDB Connection: A connection is established with MongoDB using the MongoDB URI, enabling access to a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas cluster
•	Upload Excel Data: The Excel file (`wikipedia_data.xlsx`) is uploaded into the environment for processing.
•	Read Excel into a DataFrame: The uploaded Excel file is read into a Pandas DataFrame using the `read_excel` function.
•	Convert Data to Records: The DataFrame is converted into a list of dictionaries (`records`), the format required for insertion into MongoDB.
•	Insert Data into MongoDB: The data is inserted into a MongoDB collection using the `insert_many` function, which stores the data in the specified database and collection.
•	Print Success Messages: A success message is printed after the data is successfully inserted.
